# Knowledge Ark's Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a pleasant experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advances.
* Trolling or making insulting/derogatory comments.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at malo@fajne.to. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.
